# Exercise on Objects: Store's Product Management

You're overseeing the management of a store's products. Each product in your inventory has a name, a brand, a category, and an indication of whether it's on sale or not.

**Features to develop:**

- Addition: Write a function that adds a new product to your inventory.
- Search: Write a function that searches for a product by name, brand, or category.
- Status: Write a function that modifies the status of a product (on sale/not on sale).
- Recommendation: Write a function that recommends a product from a specific category that's not on sale.
- Deletion: Write a function that removes a product from your inventory using the name as a reference
